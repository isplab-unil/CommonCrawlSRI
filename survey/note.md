# Setting up

## Cognitive Interviews **Inspired by - Exploring User Mental Models of End-to-End Encrypted Communication Tools** 

* Create an initial questionnaire
* Administer to a small and diverse group of people to assess it
* The interviewer should ask the participants to share their thoughts and how they answer each survey question.
* After answering each question, ask
  * “Was this question difficult to answer?”
  * “Was there an answer choice missing?” 
  * “How did answering this question make you feel?”
* Use the findings to iteratively revise and rewrite survey questions to minimize bias and maximize validity
* Ask human-computer interaction researchers with survey expertise to review survey questionnaire and evaluate question wording, ordering and bias.
